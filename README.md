### wheretofindme
My preferred method of contact for just about anything formal would be my email, [puggo@puggo.space](mailto:puggo@puggo.space).     
If you'd just like to talk about a project (or something else) you can also contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/heyitspuggo) direct messages.
> Be warned; as dragons may lurk on my Twitter. I don't always retweet the most "safe-for-work" content.

I've also got a profile on [rustaceans.org](https://www.rustaceans.org/search/heyitspuggo) if you'd like to see that for more social links.
